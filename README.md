# PHP Dir
All my PHP files that I have on my laptop.

I have the ones for my website (cubanomics.comxa.com).
And some random ones. Maybe for help.

# Other Files
I also have some HTML, JavaScript, and of course PHP in here somewhere. So you can use those aswell...

No one will probably even see this, so whatever. 
Thanks GitHub.
